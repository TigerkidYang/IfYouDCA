      <p>For decades, investors have debated a core question: which U.S. index offers the superior long-term return? To provide a data-driven answer, we used our <a href="/">Historical Dollar-Cost Averaging Calculator</a> to simulate a simple yet powerful strategy: <strong>investing $500 every month for exactly 20 years.</strong></p>
      <p>We pitted the S&P 500 (via the SPY ETF) against the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 (via the QQQ ETF). The interactive chart below shows the result for the S&P 500. Use the toggle to compare it directly with the NASDAQ 100 and see the dramatic difference in performance.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">By the Numbers: A Clear Victory</h2>
      <p>The results of this 20-year backtest are striking. While both strategies turned a total investment of $120,000 into a substantial nest egg, one index was the undeniable winner.</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside my-4 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>S&P 500 (SPY):</strong> The consistent $500 monthly investment grew to approximately <strong>$491,784</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>NASDAQ 100 (QQQ):</strong> The same strategy in the NASDAQ 100 resulted in a final value of approximately <strong>$879,264</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As you can see, the NASDAQ 100 portfolio was nearly <strong>80% larger</strong> than the S&P 500 portfolio. This stark difference highlights the incredible impact of the tech sector's explosive growth over the past two decades, which is heavily represented in the NASDAQ.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion: Risk, Reward, and the Power of Consistency</h2>
      <p>While the NASDAQ 100 was the clear winner in this historical showdown, it's traditionally considered a more volatile, higher-risk index. The S&P 500 offers broader market diversification. The best choice always depends on an individual's risk tolerance and long-term goals.</p>
      <p>However, the most important lesson from this dollar-cost averaging backtest is the power of consistency. Regardless of the index chosen, a disciplined, long-term investment strategy proved to be incredibly effective at building wealth.</p>

      <p>Financial advisors constantly preach the gospel of "starting early." But what concrete difference can a mere 10 years make? To answer this, we used our <a href="/">DCA calculator</a> to run a classic dollar-cost averaging scenario: two investors, same asset, same monthly contribution, just a 10-year difference in their start date.</p>
      <p>The interactive result below shows an investor who began putting $100 a month into an S&P 500 ETF in 1994. Use the toggle to see the dramatic difference compared to someone who waited until 2004 to start.</p>
      
      [INTERACTIVE_CALCULATOR_HERE]
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Results: A Costly Decade of Delay</h2>
      <p>The data paints a powerful picture of the price of procrastination. Let's break down the numbers:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside my-4 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Started in 1994 (30 Years):</strong> With a total investment of $36,100, the portfolio grew to approximately <strong>$191,887</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Started in 2004 (20 Years):</strong> With a total investment of $24,100, the portfolio grew to approximately <strong>$84,147</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Think about that: by investing just <strong>$12,000 more</strong> over an extra decade, the early investor's portfolio ended up more than <strong>double the size</strong>—an astounding $107,740 difference in final value. That first decade, where compound growth had the longest time to work its magic, was responsible for the vast majority of the gains.</p>
            
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion: The Best Time to Plant a Tree Was 20 Years Ago</h2>
      <p>This simple backtest provides undeniable proof: the single most powerful ally an investor has is <strong>time</strong>. The second-best day to start your dollar-cost averaging journey is today.</p>

    summary:
      "Is it smart to keep investing during a downturn? We stress-test the dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy through the 2008 crisis and beyond. The results are astonishing.",
    publishDate: "2025-07-26",

      asset: "SPY",
      initialInvestment: 0,

      <p>For many investors, the scariest moment is a market crash. The instinct is to sell or stop investing. But proponents of dollar-cost averaging (DCA) argue that downturns are actually the best times to buy. Is this true? We used our <a href="/">backtesting tool</a> to analyze an investor who started a $1,000 monthly investment right before the 2008 financial crisis and held on.</p>
      <p>The interactive result below shows this investor's journey with the S&P 500 (SPY). Use the toggle to compare it against a more volatile, high-growth stock like NVIDIA (NVDA) during the same turbulent period.</p>

      [INTERACTIVE_CALCULATOR_HERE]

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Turning Fear into Astonishing Opportunity</h2>
      <p>The numbers from this stress test are a powerful testament to the DCA strategy:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside my-4 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>S&P 500 (SPY):</strong> A total investment of $222,000 through multiple market crises, including 2008 and 2020, grew to an impressive <strong>$861,420</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>NVIDIA (NVDA):</strong> The same investment in a high-conviction tech stock yielded an almost unbelievable result, growing to over <strong>$50.5 million</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By continuing to buy at lower prices during the crash, an investor significantly lowers their average cost per share. When the market eventually recovered, the returns were amplified dramatically. This simulation proves that a consistent dollar-cost averaging strategy turns periods of market fear into incredible buying opportunities.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion: Discipline Forges Diamonds</h2>
      <p>This backtest demonstrates a core principle of DCA: it removes emotion from the equation. While NVIDIA's result is an outlier, the strong performance of the S&P 500 shows that the strategy's true strength is revealed not when the market is climbing, but when a disciplined investor continues to buy when others are fearful.</p>
